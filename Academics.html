<h4 class="section-subheader"> AP Morris: Hillside, New Jersey </h4>
  <p class="section-content">I went to this school for large part of my childhood, yet I don't remember it well. I remember the town and the people that lived there better than I remember the schools. This means that I cannot tell you much about my academic experience in this school, except for the fact that nap time was heavenly.</p>
<h4 class="section-subheader"> St.Michael's</h4>
  <p class="section-content">I went to St. Michael's for two years. I liked that we had uniforms because it made it easier to dress. I don't remember much else from that school.</p>
<h4 class="section-subheader"> Livingtson Avenue School</h4>
  <p class="section-content"> I'm going to be honest here, I'm a very forgetful person. Throughout this website, you'll come to realize that a lot of things are unfinished or I say that I don't remember. I'm sorry, I really don't.</p>
<h4 class="section-subheader"> Orange Avenue School </h4>
  <p class="section-content"> I went to this school for 4 years. I met a lot of friends at this school that I've now come to miss a lot at my new one. I made it into my first honors classes and joined my first clubs. I created a lot of great relationships and opportunities for myslef that I am very proud of. Of course I made mistakes, but  it was all part of growing up. </p>
