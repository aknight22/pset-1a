<h4> AP Morris: Hillside, New Jersey </h4>
  <p>I went to this school for large part of my childhood, yet I don't remember it well. I remember the town and the people that lived there better than I remember the schools. This means that I cannot tell you much about my academic experience in this school, except for the fact that nap time was heavenly.</p>
<h4> St.Michael's</h4>
  <p>I went to St. Michael's for two years. I liked that we had uniforms because it made it easier to dress. I don't remember much else from that school.</p>
<h4> Livingtson Avenue School</h4>
  <p> I'm going to be honest here, I'm a very forgetful person. Throughout this website, you'll come to realize that a lot of things are unfinished or I say that I don't remember. I'm sorry, I really don't.</p>
<h4> Orange Avenue School </h4>
  <p> I went to this school for 4 years. I met a lot of friends at this school that I've now come to miss a lot at my new one. I made it into my first honors classes and joined my first clubs. I created a lot of great relationships and opportunities for myslef that I am very proud of. Of course I made mistakes, but  it was all part of growing up. </p>
<h4> Academy for Information Technology (AIT) </h4>
  <p> I've just started at this school and as you know I've made a lot of great friends and I've done a lot more for my school in general. If you would like to hear more about my school environment <a href= index.html>click here.</a> </p>
