			Hi! My name is Angelia. Welcome to my website! Here is where you can see how I've grown throughout the years and see the things I've done for my academics and community. Think of it as a portfolio, but a little more personal. Enjoy!

		 <h3>Where I'm From </h3>
			 <p>
				 Let's start with the scariest question I have ever encountered: Where am I from? I know, it's terrifying. Well, at least for me it is. I'll start by telling you about my parents, if that's appropriate. My mom was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. My father was born in Ohio. Keep up here, it's gonna get complicated. My mother moved here, as in New Jersey, when she was only sixth months old. She was raised Spanish, just as I was. My grandmother on my father's side was born in Portugal. My father looks Portuguese, but doesn't really claim his Portuguese side. That's okay, I claim it for him. My mom speaks Spanish and Portuguese, my dad speaks neither. I try to speak both. I would say I'm Uruguayian and Portuguese when people ask me where I'm from, but if you ask me where I was born that's a little different. I was born and raised in New Jersey. My first house was in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The next few were in Hillside, New Jeresey; and then I moved where I live now, Cranford, New Jersey. Phew, does that answer your question?

		 <h3> Where I Go To School </h3>
			 <p>
				 I go to school at the Academy for Information Technology in Scotch Plains. I know what you're thinking: "But wait, you said you live in Cranford, not Scotch Plains!" That's true. AIT, a.k.a. Academy for Information Technology, is a vocational school. I had to apply and take tests to get into this highschool, it is not a regular public school. I can't begin to explain how proud I am to be here, and how happy I am that I chose to apply.

		 <h3> Home Life </h3>
			 <p>
				 I live in Cranford with my mom, Valeria; my brother, Jason; and the soon-to-be-father-of-my-half-brother; Mike. We have two dogs, Louie and Buddy. Louie is a constantly-tired, just-turned-five-year-old French Bulldog that is extremely protective of his toys. Buddy is a now-five-year-old Chocolate Lab that is just tall enough to stand over Louie without touching his back. This comes in handy when he steals toys from Louie. Jason, who we call Jay or JJ, is very, very interested in video games. He's two years younger than me, and fun fact: he's had glasses since he was two years old. This fact is not so fun to him, but when he takes his glasses off he goes cross-eyed, so it's just become a hard truth that he has to face. My mom is currently enrolled in college and trying to be a lawyer. She works for PSE&G and has a separate stomach just for chocolate. She passed the chocolate stomach onto me. She would've graduated a long time ago, but she had her scholarship taken away from her because they couldn't prove that the baby that came over from Uruguay was her. So, yes, she came over legally; and no, that wasn't fair. That story is not such a fun one. At my house, we enjoy cookies, a lot. We also enjoy watermelon, a lot. It smells like dog but our house is modern and I think it's pretty. Its about 95% made up of the color gray. Our home life is pretty boring amd filled with terrible jokes. That's all I've got about us for now, maybe I'll revisit later.

		 <h3> School Life </h3>
			 <p>
				 I am a sophomore at AIT. This means that I just met everyone at my school a little over a year ago. We  basically all met on the first day of school, though some of us might have met during orientation. This means we all had to learn to get used to each other fairly quickly. This wasn't so hard at my school because everyone here has really similar interests and they're all pretty nice. My friend group is pretty loud sometimes, but it's just because we're outgoing. We all really care for each other and we enjoy each other's presence. We also push each other to do better in school, since we all care about our grades a lot. I'm lucky to be surrounded by people with such kind hearts and great minds. Although we don't get to hang out as much as we'd like to outside of school, inside school is always fun because we get to see each other. My friends really helped me to get acclimated to this school last year, and I'm really glad that I have them by my side. In school, I'm pretty outgoing with the students, but I'd like to believe that I'm good at staying quiet in class. I do always like conversation, but I don't like or look to disrespect my teachers. I try my best to get good grades, and sometimes it gets me a bit upset if I don't. When I don't do as well as I would've liked to, I tend to get down on myself and make myself feel bad for it. I'm working on that. But I honestly do really enjoy school and the people there, and I can't wait for college. My dream is to go to MIT.
