  <p class="section-content">
    I started playing soccer when I was around 4 years old. I scored a goal in my own goal, and then I quit. Flashfoward about 5 years to 5th grade, when I decided to pick up soccer again because my best friend played it. I ended up loving it and I'm still playing it now. Two years ago I started playing for my first club team, US Parma. Now I am playing for FC Premier. I love soccer and I think it has taught me a lot about working with others.
