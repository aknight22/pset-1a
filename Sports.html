<h3>Soccer</h3>
  <p>I started playing soccer when I was aroound 4 years old. I scored a goal in my own goal, and then I quit. Flashfoward about 5 years to 5th grade, when I decided to pick up soccer again because my best friend played it. I ended up loving it and I'm still playing it now. Two years ago I started playing for my first club team, US Parma. Now I am playing for FC Premier. I love soccer and I think it has taught me a lot about working with others.</p>
<h3>Softball</h3>
  <p> I played softball for Cranford for a few year but I was never really too good at it. I played it because my cousin played it basically. I did like it then, but I don't play it anymore.</p>
<h3>Cheerleading</h3>
  <p> I did competitive cheerleading in Kenilworth and I did cheer for Cranford for a while,too. I did chearleading for a long time, but it didn't teach me much. </p>
<h3>Tennis, Basketball, and Dance</h3>
  <p> I put all three of these in one group since I did them for very short periods of time and they taught me close to nothing at all. Still, they deserve to be on the list because they were done, so here's to them.</p>
